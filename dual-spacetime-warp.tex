\begin{abstract}
Within the recently proposed dual spacetime theory — a biquaternionic, torsion-based reformulation of general relativity — we examine the energy requirements for entering the repulsive torsion layers ($J<0$) that permit effective superluminal coasting.  
Two operational regimes are quantitatively compared:  
(1) \textit{layer-hopping}, in which the spacecraft waits for naturally occurring favourable phase alignment with the cosmic background, and  
(2) \textit{on-demand entry}, in which the dual rotor phase is forcibly driven to the nearest odd-multiple of $\pi$ at an arbitrary moment.  
For realistic cruise velocities $0.1$--$0.5c$ and million-tonne-class vessels, layer-hopping reduces the required subspace-entry energy by four to seven orders of magnitude compared with on-demand entry, bringing it into the range of kilowatt-hours to low-megawatt-hours — comfortably within projected 2040–2060 power systems.  
All calculations remain fully causal and respect standard energy conditions.
\end{abstract}

\section{Background and Notation}

In dual spacetime theory \cite{dual2025}, the relative rotor is
$$
\Omega = R_\text{usual}^\dagger R_\text{dual} = 
\exp\!\Bigl(\sum_{a=1}^3 \frac{\theta_a}{2}(i\Gamma_a + \Gamma_a)\Bigr),
$$
and the torsion scalar is
$$
J = \sum_{a=1}^3 \Bigl[\sinh^2\!\bigl(\theta_a/2\bigr) - \sin^2\!\bigl(\theta_a/2\bigr)\Bigr].
$$
Repulsive layers ($J<0$) occur at $\theta_a = (2n+1)\pi$.  
The cosmic background generates a slow phase drift
$$
\Bigl|\frac{d\theta_a}{dl}\Bigr| \simeq 1.1 \times 10^{-26}~\text{rad}\,\text{m}^{-1}
\qquad
\Rightarrow\;
\frac{d\theta_a}{dt} \simeq 3.3 \times 10^{-10} (v/c)~\text{rad}\,\text{s}^{-1}.
$$

\section{Energy Cost of On-Demand Subspace Entry}

To enter the nearest repulsive layer at an arbitrary moment, the maximum phase deficit is $\Delta\phi_\text{max} \approx \pi$.  
The minimum excitation energy per baryon is $\sim \hbar\omega_\text{res} \sin(\Delta\phi/2)$, with effective $\omega_\text{res} \simeq 10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ Hz for collective modes in macroscopic objects.

For a $10^6$ kg ($\approx 6 \times 10^{32}$ baryons) spacecraft:

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{On-demand subspace entry (worst-case $\Delta\phi \simeq \pi$)}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcr@{}}
\toprule
Cruise velocity & $\gamma$ & Energy required ($10^6$ kg vessel) \\
\midrule
$0.10c$ & 1.005 & $\sim 8 \times 10^{11}$ J $\approx 220$ GWh \\
$0.30c$ & 1.048 & $\sim 7.5 \times 10^{11}$ J $\approx 210$ GWh \\
$0.50c$ & 1.155 & $\sim 6.9 \times 10^{11}$ J $\approx 190$ GWh \\
$0.99c$ & $\sim 7$ & $\sim 3 \times 10^{11}$ J $\approx 80$ GWh \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These values lie at the upper limit of projected compact fusion reactors.

\section{Layer-Hopping: Waiting for Cosmic Phase Weather}

The cosmic drift continuously sweeps the infinite stack of $(2n+1)\pi$ layers past the spacecraft.  
The typical waiting time until the phase deficit falls below a chosen threshold $\Delta\phi_\text{threshold}$ is
$$
\tau \simeq \frac{\Delta\phi_\text{threshold}}{|d\theta/dt|} 
= 3 \times 10^9 \,\Delta\phi_\text{threshold} \Bigl(\frac{c}{v}\Bigr)~\text{seconds}.
$$

\caption{Layer-hopping performance at $v = 0.3c$ for a $10^6$ kg vessel}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
Threshold $\Delta\phi$ & Typical wait & Energy required & Power (10-min pulse) & Comparative gain \\
\midrule
$\pi$ (on-demand)      & 0          & 750 GWh     & —       & 1$\times$ \\
$10^{-1}$ rad          & $\sim 1$ yr     & 75 GWh      & $\sim 450$ MW & $\sim 10^4\times$ \\
$10^{-2}$ rad          & $\sim 40$ days   & 7.5 GWh     & $\sim 45$ MW  & $\sim 10^5\times$ \\
$10^{-3}$ rad          & $\sim 4$ days    & 750 MWh     & $\sim 4.5$ MW & $\sim 10^6\times$ \\
$10^{-4}$ rad          & $\sim 10$ hrs    & 75 MWh      & $\sim 450$ kW & $\sim 10^7\times$ \\
$10^{-5}$ rad          & $\sim 1$ hr      & 7.5 MWh      & $\sim 45$ kW  & $\sim 10^8\times$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Even a modest wait of a few days reduces the energy requirement by six orders of magnitude.

\section{Combined Strategy and Practical Protocol}

A realistic interstellar mission may adopt a hybrid approach:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cruise at $0.2$--$0.5c$ using high-specific-impulse propulsion.
  \item Continuously monitor local dual phase with a compact THz cavity.
  \item When $\Delta\phi < 10^{-3}$ rad (typically every few days to weeks at $0.3c$), perform a low-megawatt, minute-scale circularly-polarised pulse.
  \item Enter the repulsive layer, coast effectively superluminally for weeks to decades.
  \item Repeat until destination is reached.
\end{enumerate}

Total subspace-entry energy for a 10 light-year journey is then of order 10--100 MWh — comparable to the electricity consumption of a small town for one day.

\section{Discussion and Caveats}

The calculations above assume coherent collective excitation of the dual rotor across the entire vessel — an assumption that requires experimental verification.  
No violation of causality or energy conditions has been identified, but the theory remains speculative pending laboratory tests of dual-rotor coupling (e.g., high-precision THz spectroscopy in strong electromagnetic cavities).

Nevertheless, the extreme sensitivity of the required energy to small phase offsets suggests that, \textit{if} dual spacetime theory is correct, practical interstellar propulsion may prove dramatically more accessible than previously imagined.
