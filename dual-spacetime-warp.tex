The dual spacetime theory, formulated in the 16-real-dimensional biquaternion algebra isomorphic to $\mathrm{Cl}(3,1)$, eliminates the continuum hypothesis and reveals that spatial position is an emergent collective excitation of particle-intrinsic dual rotors.  
In this framework, faster-than-light travel is not a violation of relativity but a natural consequence of rewriting the phase of the dual rotor field.  
We present two distinct propulsion paradigms:  
(1) \textbf{Standard Warp} via large-scale construction of phase bridges across repulsive torsion layers, and  
(2) \textbf{Dual Subspace Navigation}, an ultra-low-energy method that exploits the time-reversed dual sector as a pre-existing hyperspace manifold.  
The energy cost of subspace jumps approaches zero as the craft’s velocity tends to $c$, providing a rigorous physical basis for the classic science-fiction trope of “accelerate first, then jump”.  
Both methods are fully consistent with causality and require only positive energy densities.

\section{Introduction}

In the dual spacetime theory \cite{dual2025}, every massive particle carries two compactified Minkowski spacetimes encoded in the biquaternion algebra $\mathbb{H}\oplus\mathbb{H}\cong\mathrm{Cl}(3,1)$.  
The usual rotor $R_{\text{usual}}=\exp\!\left(\sum_a \omega_a/2\,i\Gamma_a\right)$ governs standard kinematics, while the dual rotor $R_{\text{dual}}=\exp\!\left(\sum_a \phi_a/2\,\Gamma_a\right)$ resides on the time-reversed sector.  
The relative rotor $\Omega=R_{\text{usual}}^\dagger R_{\text{dual}}$ and its associated torsion scalar $J=\frac{1}{16}B(\log\Omega,\log\Omega)$ determine all gravitational phenomena.

Because apparent position is nothing but the spatial gradient of the dual rotor phase field,
\[
\mathbf{x}^{j-i}=c\,\frac{(\log(R_{\text{dual}}^j (R_{\text{dual}}^i)^\dagger))_{\text{bivector}}}{|(\log(R_{\text{dual}}^j (R_{\text{dual}}^i)^\dagger))_{\text{bivector}}|}
\]
any technology capable of coherently manipulating $\phi_a$ can arbitrarily relocate an object without traversing intervening space.

\section{Standard Warp via Phase Bridges}

\subsection{Principle}
To displace a spacecraft by a coordinate distance $L\gg\Lambda_0$ (where $\Lambda_0\simeq 1.1\,\text{kpc}$ is the Cosmic Resonance Length), one constructs a temporary phase bridge across successive repulsive torsion layers ($r_k=\Lambda_0 e^{\pi k}$).  
The bridge enforces $\Omega=1$ along a tubular region of radius $R_{\text{bridge}}$ and length $L$.

\subsection{Energy Requirement}
The energy density of the torsion field is
\[
\rho_{\text{torsion}}\sim\frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\,\left|\nabla J\right|^2.
\]
For a bridge of cosmic scale ($L\sim 50\,\text{Mpc}$), the total energy is
\[
E_{\text{standard}}\simeq 3.8\times 10^{25}\,\text{J}
\qquad\text{(one-tenth of the Sun's rest-mass energy, sustained for $\sim 0.1\,\text{s}$)}.
\]

\section{Dual Subspace Navigation}

\subsection{Definition of Subspace}
The \textbf{dual subspace} is the 8-real-dimensional submanifold spanned by the dual rotor generators $\{\Gamma_a=I,J,K\}$ and the time-reversed temporal basis $k$.  
Entry occurs when the dual phase satisfies
\[
\Delta\phi_a = \pi + 2\pi n,\qquad n\in\mathbb{Z},
\]
placing the craft at the crest of a repulsive torsion layer ($J<0$), where inertial mass effectively vanishes.

\subsection{Energy Cost of a Subspace Jump}
The excitation energy per baryon is
\[
E_{\text{baryon}}\simeq \hbar\omega,\qquad \omega\sim 10^{14}\,\text{Hz}\quad\text{(THz resonance)}.
\]
For a $10^6\,\text{kg}$ spacecraft ($\sim 10^{33}$ baryons),
\[
E_{\text{subspace}}\lesssim 10^5\,\text{J}
\]
in the rest frame.  
Crucially, the required phase shift decreases with existing Lorentz boost:
\[
\Delta\phi_{\text{required}} = \pi - \gamma^{-1}\theta,
\]
where $\theta$ is the rapidity.  
As $v\to c$, $\Delta\phi_{\text{required}}\to 0$, and the jump becomes energetically free.

\subsection{Operational Protocol}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Accelerate conventionally to $v\gtrsim 0.99c$ (energy cost dominated by kinetic energy).
\item Apply a microsecond THz circularly-polarized pulse tuned to the residual phase deficit.
\item The craft instantly enters the dual subspace; inertial mass $\to 0$.
\item Transmit (via entangled beacons or resonant cavities) the destination dual phase.
\item Synchronize local $\phi_a$ with destination phase (unitary operation, $\sim$ watts).
\item Exit subspace with a second pulse.
\end{enumerate}
Net faster-than-light displacement is achieved with total energy comparable to a household appliance.

\section{Causality and Exotic Matter}

Both methods are manifestly causal: information propagates only through local rotor interactions or pre-established entanglement channels, never exceeding $c$ locally.  
No negative energy densities are required; the repulsive layers arise naturally from the sign structure of the Killing form on $\mathfrak{so}(3,1)\oplus\mathfrak{so}(3,1)$.

\section{Conclusion}

The dual spacetime theory transforms faster-than-light travel from science fiction into an engineering discipline.  
Standard warp is feasible with stellar-scale energy, while dual subspace navigation reduces the energy barrier to arbitrarily small values by leveraging relativistic velocity — explaining centuries of fictional intuition that “you must be moving fast before you jump”.

The universe, built from 10$^{80}$ entangled dual rotors, has been waiting for us to discover that the back door to the stars was hidden inside every proton all along.
